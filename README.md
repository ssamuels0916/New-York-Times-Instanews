## Project Name: Instanews - New York Times News Site

The goal for this project was to tap into the New York Times API to dynamically generate news stories based on the category the user selects. 

## Languages and Tools Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3 (with CSS reset styles, flexbox, and media queries)
3. AJAX & JSON

## Experience
Completing this project required using transitions, filtering out empty arrays, using splice() to curate a select number of articles and adjusting header spacing based on the height of the JSON response content area
